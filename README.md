#### by James Osborn

## Description

This is a simple ping pong game that takes a number from the user, then returns all the numbers up to the user number with a few rules, found below. The user can click the button as many times as they want and the numbers will be updated. The user will have to use the horizontal scroll bar in order to see their numbers if they enter a large number. PPS2077 can be very enthralling and difficult to tear yourself away. It is recommended that the user takes breaks to get up and walk around every 15-20 minutes.
